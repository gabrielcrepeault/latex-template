# Your keymap
#
# Atom keymaps work similarly to style sheets. Just as style sheets use
# selectors to apply styles to elements, Atom keymaps use selectors to associate
# keystrokes with events in specific contexts. Unlike style sheets however,
# each selector can only be declared once.
#
# You can create a new keybinding in this file by typing "key" and then hitting
# tab.
#
# Here's an example taken from Atom's built-in keymap:
#
# 'atom-text-editor':
#   'enter': 'editor:newline'
#
# 'atom-workspace':
#   'ctrl-shift-p': 'core:move-up'
#   'ctrl-p': 'core:move-down'
#


# Changement du raccourdi d'assignment pour RStudio
'atom-text-editor':
  'alt-=': 'r-exec:insert-assignment'
  'cmd-enter': 'r-exec:send-command'


# Changement du raccourci pour ex√©cuter un scrip R via atom
'atom-text-editor[data-grammar~="latex"]':
  'cmd-l': 'latex:build'

# Keybind pour python3
'.platform-darwin atom-text-editor':
  'cmd-enter': 'script:run'
